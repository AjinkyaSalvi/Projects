Graph

01.	Program Details:

	(i)	Date: 9th April, 2020 and 5th May, 2020 respectively
	(ii)	Language: Scala

02.	Problem Statement:

	This program is for undirected graph:

	(i)	Input: Each line represents the nodes connected to each other.
		Example: 1, 2, 4 - Here node 1 is connected to node 2 and node 4.

	(ii)	Output: The program should print the size of the connected nodes.
		Example: For above input, output should be 3,
		as 1, 2, and 4, total 3 nodes are connected to each other.

03.	Working:

	(i)	First program (Graph01.scala), is the same program which was done in Hadoop MapReduce,
		except this is done is Scala - Apache Spark.

	(ii)	Second program (Graph02.scala), is done using Pregel on Spark GraphX.

04.	Code Execution: You can run this program over Apache Spark compatible server.

05.	Note: I have included sample input and output .txt files.
