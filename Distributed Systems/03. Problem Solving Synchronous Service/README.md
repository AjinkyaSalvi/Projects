
	Problem Solving Synchronous Service

	01.	Program Details:

		(i)	Date: 26th September, 2019
		(ii)	Language: Java

	02.	Problem Statement:

		(i)	Server solves following problems:
			a)	Show the value of pi,
			b)	Add two numbers,
			c)	Sort array in an ascending order, and
			d)	Multiply three matrices.

		(ii)	The Server should support synchronicity and
			the client should wait for the results from the Server.

	03.	Code Execution:

		(i)	To compile the above programs,
			change the directory of the Terminal or Command Prompt to the folder containing these files.

		(iii)	Then, enter 'javac Server.java' and 'javac Client.java' to compile these files.
			You can only run these files after compiling them.

		(iv)	Finally, to run these files correctly,
			first, run 'Server.class' by entering 'java Server' then run 'Client.class' by entering 'java Client'.

	04.	Note:

		(i)	For array passing,
			byte array can only process a small amount of data at a time.
			It fails when large data is passed to it.

		(ii)	These programs are coded without using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) or
			Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
